        <p class="texto">Good morning everybody,

            My name is Vitor, I'm 17 years old and I live in Ribeirão Preto. I'm finishing my last year at Miguel Jorge school.
            
            As for my hobbies, I love football and I'm a big Corinthians fan. My dream is to watch a Corinthians final at the stadium. I also like playing Valorant.
            
            I love fishing with my dad. My favorite type of music is funk and I'm not a big fan of reading books.
            
            I became interested in programming because I thought it was amazing to create websites and games. My parents really encouraged me to start studying programming. I've been studying programming for about 2 months. I know the basics of HTML and CSS and am currently studying JavaScript.
            
            I want to pursue game and web development. I've always been passionate about games, so I intend to develop them.
             
            I want to give my family a good life, that's my other dream and to give my country a house and a car.</p>
